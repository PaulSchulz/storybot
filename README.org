* Storybot
Short Story Vending Machine: Press a button, get a story

* Software Design
The scripts use existing programs available on a standard Linux
installation (fmt,strfile,fortune) to efficiently retrieve a random
story for printing.

Story files (text files) are stored in the 'stories' directory as
individual text files. A 'merge.sh' script (located in the 'scripts'
directory) processes these into a single file which is then indexed
(by strfile) and then used by 'fortune' to read individual stories.

To retrived a random story, use:
  make story
