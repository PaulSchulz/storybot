The Princess Bride - William Goldman

Part 1

1941. Autumn. I'm a little cranky because my radio won't get the
football games.  I lie back, listening to the soaps, and after a
little I try finding Northwestern versus Notre Dame game, and my
stupid radio will pick up every Chicago station except the one
carrying the game.  It was so frustrating I was lying there sweating
and my stomach felt crazy and I was pounding the top of the radio to
make it work right and that was how they discovered I was delirious
with pneumonia.

Pneumonia today is not what it once was, especially when I had it. Ten
days or so in the hospital and then home for the long recuperating
period. I just was this lump going through a strengthgathering time,
period. Which is how you have to think of me when I came upon The
Princess Bride.

It was my first night home. Drained; still one sick cookie. My father
came in, I thought to say good night. He sat on the end of my
bed. "Chapter One. The Bride," he said. It was then only I kind of
looked up and saw he was holding a book.
