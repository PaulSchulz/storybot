The Colour of Magic - Terry Pratchett

Chapter 1

The twin cities of Ankh-Morpork are on fire. Downtown Morpork is in
flames, and the upper class citizens of Ankh are demolishing bridges
on the far banks of the river in an attempt to prevent the fire from
spreading. The ships in the Morpork docks are ablaze, their cargoes
burned to ashes. Smoke rises miles above the cities in a black column
that can be seen across all of Discworld.

Bravd the Hublander, a barbarian, and Weasel, a swordsman, watch the
smoking city from a far hillside. They surmise who or what caused the
blaze and reminisce about the twin citiesh. Weasel spies two figures
riding towards them, along with what appears to be some sort of
animal. Bravd steps into the road to stop the first rider.
